    <h1>Philip Emeagwali</h1>

    <p>
        Philip Emeagwali is a Nigerian
        <a href="#">computer scientist</a>.
            He has been living in the United States<br>
        for many years.[1] He won the 1989 <a href="#">Gordon Bell Prize</a> ($1,000) for price-performance in<br>
        high-performance computing applications, in an oil reservoir modeling calculation using a<br>
        novel mathematical formulation and implementation.[2][3]

    <h2>Biography</h2>
    
    <p>

        Emeagwali was born in Akure, Nigeria on 23 August 1954.[4] His early schooling was suspended in<br>
        1967 as a result of the Nigerian Civil War. At 13 years, he served in the Biafran army. After the<br>
        war he completed high-school equivalence through self-study.<br>
        He is married to Dale Brown Emeagwali, a noted African-American microbiologist.[5]

    <h2>Education</h2>


    <p>

        He traveled to the United States to study under a scholarship following completion of a<br>
        correspondence course at the University of London. He received a bachelor's degree in<br>
        mathematics from Oregon State University in 1977. He later moved to Washington DC, receiving<br>
        in 1986 a master's degree from George Washington University in ocean and marine engineering,<br>
        and a second master's in applied mathematics from the University of Maryland. Next magazine<br>
        suggested that Emeagwali claimed to have further degrees.[6][7] During this time, he worked as a<br>
        civil engineer at the Bureau of Land Reclamation in Wyoming.

    <h3>Court case and the denial of degree</h3>

    <p>

        Emeagwali studied for a Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan from 1987 through 1991.<br>
        His thesis was not accepted by a committee of internal and external examiners and thus he was<br>
        not awarded the degree. Emeagwali filed a court challenge, stating that the decision was a<br>
        violation of his civil rights and that the university had discriminated against him in several ways<br>
        because of his race. The court challenge was dismissed, as was an appeal to the Michigan state<br>
        Court of Appeals.[8]

    <h2>Supercomputing</h2>

    <p>

        Emeagwali received the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize for an application of the CM-2 massively-parallel<br>
        computer. The application used computational fluid dynamics for oil-reservoir modeling. He<br>
        received a prize in "price/performance" category, with a performance figure of about 400 <br>
        Mflops/$1M.[15] The winner in the "performance" category, was also the winner of the<br>
        Price/performance category, but unable to receive two prizes. Mobil Research and Thinking<br>
        Machines, used the CM-2 for seismic data processing and achieved the higher ratio of 500<br>
        Mflops/$1M. The judges decided on one award per entry.[3][2] His method involved each<br>
        microprocessor communicating with six neighbors.[10]<br>
        <br>
        Emeagwali's simulation was the first program to apply a pseudo-time approach to reservoir<br>
        modeling.[1]

        He was cited by Bill Clinton as an example of what Nigerians can achieve when given the <br> opportunity[17] and is frequently featured in popular press articles for
        Black History Month.[18][10]
